# UCLA Library Design Tokens

Design tokens for UCLA Library.

The **Design Tokens** repository stores and syncs design tokens from the UCLA Library Design System using the [Figma Tokens plugin](https://docs.tokens.studio/) and GitHub Actions to generate Sass variables for use. 

## What are Design Tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development. - [Salesforce UX](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)
