# UCLA Library Design Tokens

Design tokens for UCLA Library.

The **Design Tokens** repository stores and syncs design tokens from the UCLA Library Design System using the [Figma Tokens plugin](https://docs.tokens.studio/) and GitHub Actions to generate Sass variables for use. 

## What are Design Tokens?

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development. - [Salesforce UX](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com/design-tokens/)

## Requirements
This package requires [Dart Sass](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) because [LibSass is deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated). If you are using the [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) package in your project (which provides the Node.js binding to the deprecated LibSass), please replace it with the [sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass) package:
```
npm uninstall node-sass && npm install sass --save-dev
```

## Usage
Install the package:
```
npm install ucla-library-design-tokens --save-dev
```
Then in your Sass, load the module:
```
@import "~ucla-library-design-tokens/scss/typography.scss";
```
Then in your component, include the mixins:
```
.category {
  @include overline;
}
```
## Files

- `data/tokens.json` - Syncs with Figma Tokens plugin
- `data/transformed-tokens.json` - Tokens transformed to be usable by Style Dictionary
- `scss/*` - Tokens usable by developers
- `assets/*` - Assets usable by developers
